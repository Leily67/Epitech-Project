# Bug's Quest RPG

Creating an RPG in Ruby

The aim of this project is to create a community around RPGs. You will have to create a tool that allows a game to develop players through a series of quests.

Create an interface for creating quests. A quest is divided into several stages. Each time a stage is successfully completed, it is possible to answer the riddle or fight an NPC. For each quest, we therefore need to implement :
  - Several stages, each consisting of 2 choices:
  - Either answer the riddle (1 question, several answers).
  - Or fight the NPC who has "Life" and "Strength" characteristics.
